Hamming numbers are numbers of the form  

    H = 2^i * 3^j * 5^k
           where 
     i,  j,  k  ≥  0 

Hamming numbers   are also known as   ugly numbers   and also   5-smooth numbers   (numbers whose prime divisors are less or equal to 5).


Task

Generate the sequence of Hamming numbers, in increasing order.   In particular:

    Show the   first twenty   Hamming numbers.
    Show the   1691st   Hamming number (the last one below   231).
    Show the   one millionth   Hamming number (if the language – or a convenient library – supports arbitrary-precision integers).
